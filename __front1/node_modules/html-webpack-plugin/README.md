```bash
  npm i --save-dev html-webpack-plugin
```

```bash
  yarn add --dev html-webpack-plugin
```



This is a [webpack](http://webpack.js.org/) plugin that simplifies creation of HTML files to serve your `webpack` bundles. This is especially useful for `webpack` bundles that include a hash in the filename which changes every compilation. You can either let the plugin generate an HTML file for you, supply
your own template using `lodash` templates or use your own loader.

### `Plugins`

The `html-webpack-plugin` provides [hooks](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin#events) to extend it to your needs. There are already some really powerful plugins which can be integrated with zero configuration

 * [webpack-subresource-integrity](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-subresource-integrity) for enhanced asset security
 * [appcache-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/lettertwo/appcache-webpack-plugin) for iOS and Android offline usage

 * [html-webpack-harddisk-plugin](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-harddisk-plugin) can be used to always write to disk the html file, useful when webpack-dev-server / HMR are being used
 * [html-webpack-inline-source-plugin](https://github.com/DustinJackson/html-webpack-inline-source-plugin) to inline your assets in the resulting HTML file
 * [html-webpack-inline-svg-plugin](https://github.com/thegc/html-webpack-inline-svg-plugin) to inline SVGs in the resulting HTML file.

 * [preload-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/preload-webpack-plugin) for automatically wiring up asynchronous (and other types) of JavaScript chunks using `<link rel='preload'>` helping with lazy-loading
 * [link-media-html-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/yaycmyk/link-media-html-webpack-plugin) allows for injected stylesheet `<link />` tags to have their media attribute set automatically; useful for providing specific desktop/mobile/print etc. stylesheets that the browser will conditionally download
